# Routing-and-Path-Optimization

A navigation system using Python, with data structures for directed graphs and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to compute the optimal driving route under traffic conditions and restricted road types
Includes test functions to represent road networks from text data, ensuring accurate pathfinding and validation through comprehensive unit tests
